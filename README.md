# KD-Project
This Repository contains a project on Image Classification with Distribution Shift for the Final Exam of the course "Knowledge Discovery" at the University of Catania for the Masters in Data Science for Management.
This Project is focused on tackling the problem of Distribution Shift between the Train and Test Data.
The Dataset has images of 8 different Objects which are held in hand and was provided by Prof. Concetto Spampinato and Prof. Giovanni Bellitto.

I tried two different approaches one with Faster RCNN with ResNet50 v2 the other with SSD300_vgg16
